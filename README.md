# Universal-Remote-Control
Universal Remote Control is a project given in the Embedded Systems lecture in the third semester. I'm working with five other people, and I'm the leader of this team. This hardware was created to make a remote that can fit on other devices, which is the device we put into code. For example, Sony has the code "AACB" and then we can use this remote to control a specific type of Sony product, like a projector.
